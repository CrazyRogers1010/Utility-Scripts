# Utility-Scripts
I wrote these scripts to automate tasks/workflows at my previous position as an AP Physics instructor.

The script that was used to transfer grades and prepare them for uploading was my most useful and saved me hours of work and was more accurate than manually transfering grades between software systems, even if I was copying and pasting from excel.
